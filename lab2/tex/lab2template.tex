\section{User-level File System}
\subsection{Implementation}
\subsubsection{System Architecture}
% Describe the design of your FS.
I first built a large, hollow wooden rabbit. Now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I, wait until nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise -- not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
\subsubsection{FUSE Calls Implemented}
% Explain what FUSE calls you implement, and what you do for each call.
I only implemented three calls: "Ni!", "it", and "Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoom-boing-mumble-mumble".
For the first call, I go and get a shrubbery. For the second and third calls, I fart in your general direction.
\subsubsection{Miscellaneous}
% Include time spent on the lab.
A year passed. Winter changed into Spring. Spring changed into Summer. Summer changed back into Winter. And Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn.
\subsection{Evaluation}
\subsubsection{Experiment Design}
% Describe the experiment you designed.
Since witches are made of wood, and wood floats in water, then we can simply measure her weight. If she weighs the same as a duck, she must be a witch! 
\subsubsection{Results}
% Include scenarios where your FS is significantly faster than NFS and vice versa.
As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:witch-duck-weight}, the average weight of the suspected witch was on average 128lbs, with a standard deviation of 5lbs. This means she weighs almost the same as a duck, so we can say with 95\% confidence that she is a witch!
% Should include at least one graph, but probably more.

\section{System Tools Exercises}
\renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\Alph{subsection}}
\subsection{strace} 
Include the file session\_record, and describe what you learned from this exercise.
\subsection{lsof}
What kind of devices do you see listed?   Sometimes you can use this trick to debug a lack of audio output. 
DO NOT include the output of this command.
\subsection{Network Tools}
Include the name of the interface your machine is using to communicate externally (<eth0>).
Questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Are DHCP messages sent over UDP or TCP? 
    \item What is the link-layer (e.g., Ethernet) address of your host? (Feel free to obscure the last couple bytes for privacy's sake)
    \item What is the IP address of your DHCP server?
    \item What is the purpose of the DHCP release message?
    \item Does the DHCP server issue an acknowledgment of receipt of the client's DHCP request?
    \item What would happen if the client's DHCP release message is lost?
\end{enumerate}
