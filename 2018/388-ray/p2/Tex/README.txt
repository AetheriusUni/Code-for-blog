~-3: Explanation of advantage of model where orthographic features are added to the input of the LSTM is not precise.
It is not just the case that more weights are being trained, otherwise we could replace the LSTM with a multi layer net.
The precise design of LSTM (hidden, cell state propagation) is very important.
