Good beam search extension and good performance overall!
For the writeup, you should include your best number / overall performance results in a table rather than just a graph (and the graph should have larger text).

For profiling/timing, you should run on a larger number of sentences to reduce variance
-- patterns of memory accesses, etc. aren't necessarily exposed accurately on one example (referring to the nanos experiment).
Extension should be slightly more analytical: try to shed light on why the results are the way they are.
